# ðŸš— Car Rental System (Java Console App)
Car Rental System is a console-based Java application that enables rental agencies to manage a fleet of cars, handle rentals and returns, and maintain records using file-based storage. The project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
